            Just found her old recipe book with it in it.</p>

        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups fresh spinach</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 ¼ tablespoons dried parsley</li>
            <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to prepare</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and 
                stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until 
                the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no 
                longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. 
                Stir in the spinach and cook until wilted, 
                about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow 
                to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a bowl. Add the 
                Parmesan, parsley, bread crumbs, olive oil, 
                egg, garlic salt, and pepper and mix well. 
                Run the filling through a grinder until smooth 
                (or puree in a food processor until smooth).</li>
            <li>The filling can be kept in the refrigerator 
                for up to four days or in the freezer for up 
                to three months.</li>
        </ol>
