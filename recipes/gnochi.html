        <h1>Gnochi</h1>
        <p>Gnocchi is simple to make with just three ingredients:
             mashed potato, flour, and egg. This recipe is one my 
             family has used for generations.</p>

        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to prepare</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; 
                add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm,
                 about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a
                  fork or potato masher.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg 
                in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a 
                ball. Shape small portions of the dough into 
                long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes 
                into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a 
                boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes 
                or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and 
                serve.</li>
        </ol>
